 -- Driver code directory --

 * This gives simple test driver codes.

 * Files:
   - LJ.f90: Calculates the Lennard-Jones potential/forces/virial.
   - SG.f90: Calculates the Silvera-Goldman potential/forces/virial.
   - distance.f90: Deals with calculating the separation between atoms and
      the neighbour list calculation.
   - sockets.c: Contains the functions to create the client socket and read from
      and write to it.
   - driver.f90: Socket interface for the driver codes.
   - Makefile: A makefile that which compiles all the fortran code as 
      necessary.

 * There are also two shell scripts for running the RPMD runs easily. These are:
   - launch_multi.sh: This starts an entire run of 100 tests.
   - launch.sh: This starts one of the runs. Note that you will have to replace
      the host name to whatever the name of your local network is.

 * Let us say that in the RPMD directory you have run run_3, which has an
   initial port number of 31413. To start the driver codes then, you need do:

$ qsub launch_multi.sh 31413

 * To run all the RPMD driver codes, simply do: 

$ for a in `seq 31411 31415`; do qsub launch_multi.sh $a; done

A list of things that should be fixed or improved
Format of "bug-reports":

PRIORITY  Title of bug (REPORTER) (ASSIGNEE)
Longer description....

PRIORITY:
*    Can wait
**   Should be done before release
***  High priority
**** Code broken! Must fix now!
The person who "reports" a bug should indicate his initials in the title.
If one decides to actively work on one issue, it should indicate it on the title line.


**   Clean up help (MC)  
New dynamic attributes should be properly included in the documentation. 
Also, the whole input generation method should be bug-checked and documented with comments in the code.

**   Robust input defaults (MC)
In many places the default value of a storage class is set by defining 
fields = { "tag" : ( Class, { "default" : EngineClass(default paramenters) } ) }
This is bad, because the class is generated at parse time, and 
just one default object will be returned by any instance of the 
container Input class. 
Defaults which are not immutable (strings, ints or floats) should be defined by
overloading the __init__ class and calling the parent class with the appropriate default, e.g.
InputSimulation.__init__(self, .... default=None, ....):
   if (default is None): default=WhateverClass(parameters)
   super(InputSimulation,self).__init__(..... default=default ...)

**** Make the new NM thing actually work (MC) (MC)

***  Move the synchro business out of Beads and into NormalModes (MC) (MC)

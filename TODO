**   Should be done before release
***  High priority
**** Code broken! Must fix now!
The person who "reports" a bug should indicate his initials in the title.
If one decides to actively work on one issue, it should indicate it on the title line.

**   Clean up help (MC)
The whole input generation method should be bug-checked.

*   Implement NST (MC) (MC)

* Merge the io_xyz.py, io_binary.py and io_pdb.py files (JM)

** Finish writing the manual (JM) (JM)

** Alternative communication mechanisms not relying on sockets (MC)

*** Fix the 'dummy' thermostat/barostat options. At the moment, forgetting
to set the barostat style doesn't give an error, and then you get a
fairly unhelpful error message to go with it. (JM)

** Clean and document the new force/forcefield/system mechanism (MC)

** Triple check that softexit mechanism is thread-safe

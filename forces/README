 -- Driver code directory --

 * This gives simple test driver codes.

 * Files:
   - LJ.f: Lennard-Jones driver.
   - interface_LJ.F: Socket interface for the Lennard-Jones driver.
   - SG.f: Silvera-Goldman driver.
   - interface_SG.F: Socket interface for the Silvera-Goldman driver.
   - sys_vars.f: Holds simple classes used in the other files.
   - oned.F: Holds a simple one dimensional harmonic potential.
   - Makefile: A makefile that which compiles all the fortran code as 
      necessary.
   - xml_read.f: A module giving functions to read xml style files.

 * There are also two shell scripts for running the RPMD runs easily. These are:
   - launch_multi.sh: This starts an entire run of 100 tests.
   - launch.sh: This starts one of the runs

 * Let us say that in the RPMD directory you have run run_3, which has an
   initial port number of 31413. To start the driver codes then, you need do:

$ qsub launch_multi.sh 31413

 * To run all the RPMD driver codes, simply do: 

$ for a in `seq 31411 31415`; do qsub launch_multi.sh $a; done

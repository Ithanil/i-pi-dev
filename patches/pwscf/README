 * This directory gives the patches required to compile the driver codes such
   that they can be used with wrap-PI.

 * Files:
   - driver.f90: Gives the module that replaces the internal MD loop of the 
      Quantum-Espresso code such that it can be used as a driver.
   - pw-driver.patch: A diff file that can be used to edit the Quantum-Espresso 
      code so that it can be used as a driver.

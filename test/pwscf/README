 -- Running the q-Espresso example --

* Patch and compile q-Espresso

* In the main example directory run 
$ python ../../src/main.py lithium.xml

* In another terminal, create copies of the pwrun directory, change in  and launch the patched pw.x

$ cp -r pwrun pw-1
$ cd pw-1
$ pw-driver.x < driver.in

* Repeat several times to get multiple instances

* To run q-Espresso remotely, you should:
 1. make sure that the machine you run wrap-pi on has a port accessible from outside
 2. change the <interface> option in lithium.xml so that <address> points to the external network interface
    (i.e. give a fully-qualified domain name or IP address rather than localhost) and that the <port>
    selected is accessible from outside
 3. change the srvaddress input parameter in driver.in, making it point to the same address and port
 4. copy pwrun to the remote machine (do not forget the pseudo!) and launch n copies of pw-driver.x remotely

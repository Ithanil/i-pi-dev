 -- RPMD Example with the rudimentary PH2 code --

 * Files:
   Makefile: Makefile for the post-processing fortran code.
   pproc.sh: Shell script used to run the post processing.
   vel_est.f: Analyses one of the output trajectory files in order to 
      find the velocity-velocity autocorrelation function.
   consolidate.f: Takes all the individual velocity-velocity autocorrelation
      functions generated by vel_est.f and averages them into a final 
      file, by default mom_corr_tot.out
   launch.sh: A bash shell script to run the trajectories.
   mkclean.sh: A bash shell script to remove all the output files from the
      run_x directories.

 * This takes the example from the paper Thomas F. Miller and David E. 
   Manolopoulos, J. Chem. Phys. 122, 184503, (2005), and does the RPMD example
   at the state point: (N, V, T) = (108, 31.7 cm**3 mol**(-1), 25 K).

 * Each of the run_x directories have one input file that is and equilibrated
   restart file. From this 100 different trajectories are launched, each
   in the NVE ensemble, and starting from the end of the last trajectory.
   At the start of each trajectory, the velocities are re-initialised from
   a Boltzmann distribution. In this way we can overcome the poor ergodicity
   of NVE PIMD runs, and sample enough of phase space to get a good estimate
   of the velocity-velocity autocorrelation function using the RPMD 
   technique.

 * The first thing that must be done to run this is to change the hostname
   in all the run_x/input.xml files to the name of the cluster you are running
   on.

 * There is one shell script used for starting the runs: launch.sh
   This will run from one of the run_x directories, and start each of the
   trajectories once the previous one has finished.

 * For example, let us say that we wish to run run_3. The input file for run_3
   uses port number 31413. Therefore to run this we change to the directory
   run_3, and then input the following command:

$ bash -c "bash ../launch.sh 31413 &"

 * To do all of the runs, you can use:

$ for a in `seq 1 5`; do port=$((31416-$a)); cd run_$a; bash -c "bash ../launch.sh $port &"; cd .. ; done

 * Instructions on how to run the driver code is given in the forces directory.

 * Once all the trajectories in all the run_x directories have been completed, 
   there are a couple of fortran files which can be used to generate the 
   velocity-velocity autocorrelation function.

 * First, vel_est.f analyses a particular output trajectory file to generate
   the estimate from one of the individual trajectories. It is run in the
   run_x directory, and takes as an argument the index of the file of interest.

 * Secondly, consolidate.f takes all the individual estimates and averages them
   to give a final estimate for the velocity-velocity autocorrelation function.

 * To make running these easier, a shell script pproc.sh is provided to be
   used once all of the trajectories have been completed. This can be run on 
   a cluster using:

$ qsub pproc.sh

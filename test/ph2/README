 -- Example with the rudimentary LJ/PH2 code --

 * First, compile the driver code in forces/. Should be as simple as make.
   Note you may need first to compile sockets.c in src/driver before you link

 * Go back to the example directory and run
$ python ../../main.py input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/wrappi.
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the SG driver code 
 
$ path/forces/ljengine.x -u -h wrap-pi -r 15.0

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel scaling won't 
   be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in input.xml
   <interface mode="inet"> and <address>localhost</address>

  then run the driver as ljengine -h localhost -r 15.0

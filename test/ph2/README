 -- Example with the rudimentary PH2 code --

 * This gives two examples of para-H2 with the isotropic Silvera-Goldman 
   pair potential, as tested against two different papers:

   - nvt: Thomas F. Miller and David E. Manolopoulos, J. Chem. Phys. 122,
          184503, (2005)
          State point: (N, V, T) = (108, 31.7 cm**3 mol**(-1), 25 K)
   - Tuckerman: Glenn J. Martyna, Adam Hughes and Mark E. Tuckerman, J. Chem.
                Phys. 110, 3275, (1999)
                State point: (N, P, T) = (256, 0 MPa, 25 K)

 * First, compile the driver code in forces/. Should be as simple as make.
   Note you may need first to compile sockets.c in src/driver before you link

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ python ../../main.py input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/wrappi.
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the SG driver code 
 
$ path/forces/sgengine.x -u -h wrap-pi -r 15.0

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel 
   scaling won't be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in input.xml
   <interface mode="inet"> and <address>localhost</address>

  then run the driver as:

$ path/forces/sgengine.x -h localhost -r 15.0

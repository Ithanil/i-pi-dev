 -- Example with the rudimentary LJ code --

 * This gives an example of Neon with a Lennard-Jones potential 
   pair potential, as tested against the following paper:

   - pi_1: Loup Verlet, Phys. Rev. 159, 1, (1967)
           State point (N, rho, T) = (864, 0.35, 1.620)

 * First, compile the driver code in forces/. Should be as simple as make.
   Note you may need first to compile sockets.c in src/driver before you link

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ python ../../main.py input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/wrappi.
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the LJ driver code 
 
$ path/forces/ljengine.x -u -h wrap-pi -r 13.176

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel 
   scaling won't be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in input.xml
   <interface mode="inet"> and <address>localhost</address>

  then run the driver as:

$ path/forces/ljengine.x -h localhost -r 13.176

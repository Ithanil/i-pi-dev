 -- Examples of i-PI working with Yaff --
 
 -- Breathing transition of MIL-53(Al) --

 * NsT simulation of MIL-53(Al) (4 beads) starting in the large pore phase, 
   which collapses at pressures higher than 18 MPa (see e.g. Sven M.J. Rogge,
   Louis Vanduyfhuys, An Ghysels, Michel Waroquier, Toon Verstraelen, Guillaume
   Maurin and Veronique Van Speybroeck, JCTC 11, p. 5583-5597 (2015)) 

 * Uses the force field of Louis Vanduyfhuys, Toon Verstraelen, Matthias
 Vandichel, Michel Waroquier and Veronique Van Speybroeck, JCTC 8, 
 p. 3217-3231 (2012)

 * This simulation is merely an example, and NOT suited for production runs.
 
** Run the example automatically:

 * First, it is necessary to download and install Yaff. 
 
 Yaff stands for "Yet another force field". It is a pythonic force-field code
 to test-drive new models. The original motivation to develop Yaff was to 
 provide a good reference implementation of the force fields developed at the 
 Center for Molecular Modeling (CMM) at Ghent University.
 
 In its current version, Yaff is general and flexible enough to handle a large
 variety of force field models.

 * Make sure you source the env.sh file in the root directory of i-pi to
   set all the necessary enviroment variables.
 
 * The runs can be done automatically using the Makefile provided. The make 
   targets are self-explanatory. To run the example, for instance, just type:

$ make mil53

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean

** Run the example manually:

 * Go to the MIL53 directory and run

$ i-pi nst_ipi.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/ipi.
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the Yaff code using:
 
$ python run.py

   You can run multiple instances of the code.

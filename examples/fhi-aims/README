                  -- Running the FHI-AIMS examples --

 * First, it is necessary to patch and compile FHI-AIMS, and create a make.in
   file containing the path to the FHI-AIMS executable and i-pi, e.g.

AIMS:=~/bin/fhi-aims.x
IPI:=~/bin/i-pi


** Run the examples automatically:
 
 * There are two examples; h2o-npt, which gives a classical NPT simulation
   of water at 300 K and atmospheric pressure and for 16 water molecules, 
   and zundel, which gives a quantum NVT simulation of a Zundel cation under 
   the same conditions. The make targets are self-explanatory: h2o-npt and
   zundel. To run the Zundel ion calculation, for example, use:

$ make zundel

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


  
** Run the examples manually:
 
 * In the main example directory run 

$ python path/src/i-pi zundel-ipi.xml
 
 * In another terminal, create up to 6 temporary directories to run FHI-AIMS,
 and launch it from within:
 
$ mkdir run_1
$ cp *_control.in run_1/control.in
$ cp *_geometry.in run_1/geometry.in
$ cd run_1
$ $AIMS > aims.out 
 
 * Repeat several times to get multiple instances
 
 * To run FHI-AIMS remotely, you should:
    1. make sure that the machine you run i-pi on has a port accessible 
       from outside
    2. change the <ffsocket> option in zundel-ipi.xml so that <address> points
       to the external network interface (i.e. give a fully-qualified domain 
       name or IP address rather than localhost) and that the <port>
       selected is accessible from outside
    3. change the use_pimd_wrapper command so that it points to the same 
       address and port
    4. copy the FHI-AIMS inputs to the remote machine
       and launch n copies of $AIMS remotely

 -- Example with Tersoff graphene potential --

   Uses the Tersoff parameters of Lindsay and Broido PRB 81, 205441 (2010)
   to run a short simulation of graphene with the LAMMPS MD code.


** Run the examples automatically:

 * First, it is necessary to patch and compile LAMMPS, and create a make.in
   file containing the path to the executable and i-pi, e.g.

LAMMPS:=~/bin/lmp_serial
IPI:=~/bin/i-pi
 
 * The runs can be done automatically using the Makefile provided. The make 
   target is self-explanatory -- graphene. 
   To run the graphene example just type:

$ make graphene

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


** Run the examples manually:

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ python path/i-pi input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/ipi.
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the LAMMPS driver code using:
 
$ path/lammps/src/lmp_serial < in.kappa.graphene

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel 
   scaling won't be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in input.xml
   <socket mode="inet"> <port> port_no </port>

   To make the client socket connect, the in.kappa.graphene file should 
   be changed so that it has the line:

   fix 1 all driver graphene port_no

 -- Example with the q-TIP4P-F water potential --

 * This gives an example of water with the q-TIP4P-F potential
   of Scott Habershon, Thomas E. Markland and David E. Manolopoulos,
   J. Chem. Phys., 131, 024501, (2009).

 * State point: (N, V, T) = (216 water molecules, 43737 a_0**3, 298 K)

 * This demonstrates the convergence of the kinetic and potential energy
   using the ring polymer contraction method of Thomas E. Markland and
   David E. Manolopoulos, J. Chem. Phys. 129, 024105, (2008).

 * This uses the LAMMPS empirical potential molecular dynamics
   code as the client code, and so the input files for this have been
   included.


** Run the examples automatically:
 
 * These can be run automatically using the Makefile provided. The make 
   target is self-explanatory -- no_rpc. 
   To run the no_rpc example just type:

$ make no_rpc

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


** Run the examples manually:

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ python path/i-pi input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/ipi.
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the LAMMPS driver code. 
   To run the example, the following should be run:
 
$ path/lammps/src/lmp_serial < in.water

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel 
   scaling won't be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in input.xml
   <socket mode="inet"> <port> port_no </port>

   To make the client socket connect, the in.water file should be changed
   so that it has the line:

   fix 1 all driver no_rpc port_no

 -- Example with the rudimentary PH2 code --

 * This gives four examples of para-H2 with the isotropic Silvera-Goldman 
   pair potential, as tested against Glenn J. Martyna, Adam Hughes and 
   Mark E. Tuckerman, J. Chem. Phys. 110, 3275, (1999).

 * State points: (N, P, T) = (172, 0 MPa, 14/17/20/25 K)

 * To run, first compile the driver code in drivers/. 
   This should be as simple as: 

$ make


** Run the examples automatically:
 
 * These can be run automatically using the Makefile provided. The make 
   targets are self-explanatory -- 25K, 20K, 17K, 14K. 
   To run the 25K example, for instance, just type:

$ make 25K

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


** Run the examples manually:

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ python path/i-pi input_equilibrated.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/ipi.
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the SG driver code. Each of the tests
   runs using a different server address, which are related to their
   directory names. For example, the 25K problem is run using:
 
$ path/drivers/driver.x -u -h T_25K -m sg -o 15.0

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel 
   scaling won't be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in 
   input_equilibrated.xml
   <socket mode="inet"> <port> port_no </port>

  then run the driver as:

$ path/drivers/driver.x -h T_25K -m sg -o 15.0 -p port_no

 -- Example with the rudimentary PH2 code --

 * This gives an example of para-H2 with the isotropic Silvera-Goldman 
   pair potential, as tested against Thomas F. Miller and David E. Manolopoulos,
   J. Chem. Phys. 122, 184503, (2005)

 * State point: (N, V, T) = (108, 31.7 cm**3 mol**(-1), 25 K)

 * To run, first compile the driver code in drivers/. This should be as 
   simple as: 

$ make


** Run the examples automatically:
 
 * A Makefile is provided to run this example. To run simply use:

$ make nvt

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


** Run the examples manually:

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ python ../../../i-pi input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/ipi
 
 * Open a separate terminal and run the SG driver code 
 
$ path/drivers/driver.x -u -h ph2_nvt -m sg -o 15.0

   You can run multiple instances of the code; it is so fast that parallel 
   scaling won't be appreciable.

 * If your system does not support Unix domain sockets, just set in input.xml
   <socket mode="inet"> <port> port_no </port>

  then run the driver as:

$ path/drivers/driver.x -h ph2_nvt -m sg -o 15.0 -p port_no

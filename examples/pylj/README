 -- Parallel tempering example with the rudimentary LJ code --

 * This gives an example of parallel tempering on a 38 particle Lennard-Jones 
   cluster. Note that this example does not use sockets, but is an example of 
   how we can instead have a Python script which directly calculates the 
   potential and forces.

 * To run this example, first create a make.in
   file containing the path to i-pi, e.g.

IPI:=~/bin/i-pi


** Run the examples automatically:
 
 * The simulation can be run automatically using the Makefile provided. The make 
   target is self-explanatory -- paratemp. This example is run using:

$ make paratemp

 * To clean up output files:

$ make clean


** Run the examples manually:

 * Go back to the example directory and run

$ python path/i-pi input.xml
 
   the wrapper will start and sit waiting on the UDS /tmp/ipi, and then use
   the inbuilt Python Lennard-Jones script to calculate the forces
   automatically.

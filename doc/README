 -- Documentation directory --

 * This gives all the documentation for the program.

 * Files:
   - create_man.py: python script which automatically generates latex help files
      for all the classes, for use in the manual.
   - help_list.py: python script which can generate custom help files for
      the output classes, for use in the manual.
   - help.py: python script which can generate custom help files for
      each of the input classes, for use in the manual.
   - Makefile: The makefile for the automatically generated manual.
   - manual.lyx: lyx file giving the manual template.
   - mybib.bib: Bibliography file for the manual.

 * Some of the above files are used to automatically generate sections of the
   user manual, and to create an xml showing the class hierarchy. These are
   created in two directories, input_docs and help_files. File created in 
   input_docs are used only to add sections to the manual itself. 
   The useful files are put into help_files. These are:
      - manual.pdf: The user manual file. Note that for this to be created, 
         the system needs to have lyx installed.
      - manual.xml: This is an xml file that contains all the input names
         along with a description of their purpose and what values are
         expected for each of them.

 * To make the help files use:

$ make

 * To remove all the created files again, use:

$ make clean

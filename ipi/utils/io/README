IO functions directory
----------------------

 * This is the directory containing input/output functions.

 * Files/Folders:
   - __init__.py: Abstract io handling
   - backends/: Contains the different backends for writing/reading atomic
      positions such as binary format, pdb and xyz.
   - inputs/: Contains different implementations for reading/checkpointing an
      i-PI simulation. For now only xml, but in future possibly also yml/json.
